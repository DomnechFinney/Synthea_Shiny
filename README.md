# Synthea_Shiny

**Synthea_Shiny** is a Shiny application for exploring and analysing healthcare simulation data generated by [Synthea](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea). This application provides interactive tools and visualizations to better understand patient data, geospatial information, and trends in healthcare metrics.

## Features
- 📊 **Interactive visualizations**: Create plots, charts, and summaries of simulated patient data.
- 🌍 **Geospatial analysis**: Explore patient locations and distribution using interactive maps with `leaflet`.
- 🔍 **Flexible filtering**: Filter data by date ranges, demographics, and healthcare conditions.
- 📈 **Dynamic summaries**: Compute and display key statistics like averages, counts, and more.

## Required R Packages

The application depends on the following R packages:

- **[tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **[shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)**: To build the interactive web application.
- **[magrittr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/)**: For clean and readable pipelines using the `%>%` operator.
- **[lubridate](https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/)**: For handling date and time data.
- **[reshape2](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/reshape2/)**: For reshaping and aggregating datasets.
- **[Hmisc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Hmisc/)**: For advanced data summaries and utilities.
- **[leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/)**: To create interactive maps.
- **[leaflet.extras](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet.extras/)**: Additional tools for `leaflet`, including drawing and selection features.
